        You can use this template by copying all the files from a place on the internet called <a href="https://github.com/nilesh0509/HTML-PROJECTS" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This template is based on a website I made for a conference called <a href="https://nilesh05.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Nilesh</a>.
